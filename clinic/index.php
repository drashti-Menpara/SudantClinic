																		</h4>
									<p>
										Even though your tooth enamel (outer surface of tooth) is hardest & most mineralized tissue in your body, it might crack or break if you bite on something hard or receive a blow to your face due to sports or accident- particularly if your tooth was already decayed, or due to any old large amalgam filling, or bruxism (excessive teeth grinding), or due to sudden changes in mouth temperature- like eating or drinking something extremely hot & then having icy cool drinks, it can also be due to ageing.
